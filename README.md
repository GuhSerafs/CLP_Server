# CLP_Server
An Visual Studio code written in C++ to establish a TCP/IP connection with a Siemens S7-1200 PLC. The program doesn't have many functions, but you can read and write all the operands of the S7-1200. Of course you'll need the proper PLC program in the S7-1200 memory for the communication to work.
